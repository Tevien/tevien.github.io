A 2-part project that enables classifiers in any Python
package to be converted into a form that can be directly used
in the custom C++/Python analysis production pipelines used
at the LHCb experiment of CERN. A bespoke regression is performed that
converts the network structure to a faster topology and determines
the required parameters in the new topology to give the same output
values.
