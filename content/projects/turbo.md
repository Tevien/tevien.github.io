The Turbo project, initially founded in 2015, was designed to enable real-time analysis at the LHC.
The traditional approach to analysis at the LHC is to make a quick determination
of interesting proton collisions and save the entire event for later analysis.
In the new approach, the real-time reconstruction is analysed so that up to
10x more data is used. This is now the default data processing option of the LHCb
experiment.
