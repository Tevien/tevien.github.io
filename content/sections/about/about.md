I currently liaise with oncologists and radiologists to build clinically-relevant Artificial Intelligence (AI) models 
based primarily on imaging data. I am passionate about scaling machine learning and deploying new applications of such 
technologies in high data rate environments, especially with applications that make a significant practical difference 
and with companies or organisations that value innovation.
